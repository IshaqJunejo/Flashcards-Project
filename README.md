# Flashcards

Flashcards is a small personal project built mainly as an attempt to keep coding and language-learning in a single project.

### Technologies-Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JS

### Functioning

It uses local-storage to check whether the last you visited the page was today, or was some other day.
If the last time you visited the page was today, it shows you the exact same flashcards it had shown you previously.
If the last time you visited the page was not today, it randomly selects one flashcard from each of the five categories, and show them to you one by one.

If you hold your click/touch on the flahscard, it shows you the translation of the word.

I personally use this project to practice German, but it can be used to practice any language by changing the words and thier respective translation in each of the five Dictionaries of [script.js](script.js) file.
